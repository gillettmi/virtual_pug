# virtual_pug


##  Description ##
My Virtual Pug is a simple, text-based RPG about owning a pug.
It's written in python 3 and currently has no GUI (although there are plans to implement one some day)

To play, just start up the python file using python3. You make menu selections by typing in integers show in the menus.
Feed your dog too much? It'll throw up and loose health. Give your dog water and don't walk it? It'll pee the floor.
It's a fairly simple game, but beware, there's currently no save function. All progress will be lost if the game is closed.

## Future Updates ##
1. I would like to re-encorporate an enemy encounter system. There was an older version, but it was really buggy.
2. Looting system and rewards. There are simple rewards that you can get on walks, but there is no inventory system to manage what you find.

## Known Bugs ##
1. The game currently has no save function right now. Working on that.
