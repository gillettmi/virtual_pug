# virtual_pug


##  Description ##
My Virtual Pug is a simple, text-based RPG about owning a pug.
It's written in python 3 and currently has no GUI (although there are plans to implement one some day)

To play, just start up the python file using python3. You make menu selections by typing in integers show in the menus.
Feed your dog too much? It'll throw up and loose health. Give your dog water and don't walk it? It'll pee the floor.
It's a fairly simple game, but beware, there's currently no save function. All progress will be lost if the game is closed.

## Known Bugs ##
1. The walking feature has a few bugs here and there. For instance, I think it won't let you go home. I'm working on that.
2. No save function right now. Working on that too.

## Updates ##
